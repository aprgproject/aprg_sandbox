Notes

Then audience wants to work for their meal: 2+2 
Stories aren't exact or predictable 
All well drawn characters have a dominant unconscious goal. 
Acknowledge what drives you take the wheel and steer it 
Change must happen in a story 
Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty 
An itch they can't scratch 
Singular goal 
Truth that deepens understanding of who we are 
Make me care 
Make a promise in the beginning 
Stories have guidelines 
Like your main character 
Theme: "who are you?" 
Invoke a sense of wonder


First chapter
setting (interesting)
interesting circumstance (new weird occupation, )
ask your reader a interesting question (why is there a dead body? why is she poisoning the soup)
actions that shows your main character story (accomplish something)
show the character in a conflict that shows their problem (what causing the character pain, disability)
