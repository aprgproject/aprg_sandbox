Sorting Summary:

Note: lg N means log2(N)

              | Inplace | Stable | Worst    | Average  | Best    | Remarks
Selection     | Y       | N      | (N^2)/2  | (N^2)/2  | (N^2)/2 | N exchanges
Insertion     | Y       | Y      | (N^2)/2  | (N^2)/4  | N       | use for small N or partially ordered
Shell         | Y       | N      | ?        | ?        | N       | light code, subquadratic
Merge         | N       | Y      | N lg N   | N lg N   | N lg N  | N lg N guarantee, stable
Quick         | Y       | N      | (N^2)/2  | 2 N ln N | N lg N  | N lg N probabilisitc guarantee, fastest in practice
3-way quick   | Y       | N      | (N^2)/2  | 2 N ln N | N       | improves quicksort in presence of duplicate keys
Heapsort      | Y       | N      | 2*N lg N | 2*N lg N | N lg N  | N lg N guarantee, in place
???           | Y       | Y      | N lg N   | N lg N   | N lg N  | holy sorting grail

Note: There are versions of merge sort that come close to the holy sorting grail but too complex for practitioners to use.
