linked list (sequential search)     | N         | N/2          | N         | N            | N          | N/2          | N       | N             | N       | N       | No (N log N)      | equals

basic binary search tree            | N         | 1.39 log2(N) | N         | 1.39 log2(N) | N          | sqrt(N)      | height  | height        | height  | height  | Yes (N)           | compareTo
red black basic binary search tree  | 2*log2(N) | 1*log2(N)    | 2*log2(N) | 1*log2(N)    | 2*log2(N)  | 1*log2(N)    | height  | height        | height  | height  | Yes (N)           | compareTo

Note: height is proportional to log N
Note: deletion in basic BST is sqrt(N) because deletion causes the tree to be asymmetric which yields to sqrt(N) on average
